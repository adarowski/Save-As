Save As is a very basic HTML5 WordPress theme extracted from the PatientsLikeMe Tech Blog custom theme.
Really, no frills here. Just basic, semantic HTML5 markup with pretty much no styling at all.

It uses a lot of the HTML5 tags you'd expect: <header> (with <hgroup>!) for the blog title and tagline,
<footer> for the footer, <aside> for the sidebar (though I used an aside with the ID "sidebar" so that
you can use asides in your individual posts, too), <time> for proper post time-stamping, section for
the main parts of the page (like the main posts area or the comment form), <article> for individual
posts, and even <mark> for highlighting search matches (in titles only, for now) on your search results
page.

The PatientsLikeMe Tech Blog WordPress theme was originally built by Adam Darowski and Cris Necochea
of PatientsLikeMe.

This theme is free for you do whatever you please with. Go nuts.
