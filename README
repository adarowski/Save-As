Save As is a very basic HTML5 WordPress theme extracted from the PatientsLikeMe Tech Blog custom theme.
Really, no frills here. Just basic, semantic HTML5 markup with pretty much no styling at all.

The PatientsLikeMe Tech Blog WordPress theme was originally built by Adam Darowski and Cris Necochea
of PatientsLikeMe.

This theme is free for you do whatever you please with. Go nuts.
